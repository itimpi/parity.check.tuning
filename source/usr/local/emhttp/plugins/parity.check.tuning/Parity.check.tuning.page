> The main purpose of this plugin is to allow you to limit array operations such as parity checks to running at times that will not inconvenience you.
>
>If you have set this to **No** then you get the default system behavior of parity checks running without a break to completion unless you manually stop/pause/cancel them.
>
>Setting this option to **Yes** specifies that parity checks should be run in increments spread over several days/weeks.
> As an example of what this plugin can do assume
>You have a parity check you have scheduled to start on the first of every month at midnight  
>* Your past experience has shown that if the parity check runs uninterrupted it takes 30 hours to complete.  
>* You set this plugin to use 3 hour increments starting at midnight and finishing at 3.00 A.M.  
>* The parity check will now actually take 10 days elapsed time (10 x 3 = 30) so the parity check will complete on 10th of the month.  
>* You have scheduled these increments to run starting at midnight and finishing at 3:00 A.M. when you know the system is not being used.  
>* You are not worried about this increased elapsed time and will welcome the increased system responsiveness during normal use.  
>* The rest of the month this plugin will do nothing as there is no active parity check in progress when the start time for an increment comes around.
>
>**CAUTION:** If the array is stopped while an array operation is incomplete then the progress so far is lost and it can only be restarted from the beginning.  You can avoid this if you set the plugin option to resume array operations on next array start.
