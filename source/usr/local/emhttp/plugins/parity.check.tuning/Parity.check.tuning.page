> The main purpose of this plugin is to allow you to limit parity checks to running at times that will not inconvenience you.

>If you have set this to **No** then you get the default system behavior of parity checks running without a break to completion unless you manually stop/pause/cancel them.
>
>Setting this option to **Yes** specifies that parity checks should be run in increments spread over several days.
> As an example of what this plugin can do assume
>You have a parity check you have scheduled to start on the first of every month at midnight  
>* Your past experience has shown that if the parity check runs uninterrupted it takes 30 hours to complete.  
>* You set this plugin to use 3 hour increments starting at midnight and finishing at 3.00 A.M.  
>* The parity check will now actually take 10 days elapsed time (10 x 3 = 30) so the parity check will complete on 10th of the month.  
>* You have scheduled these increments to run starting at midnight and finishing at 3:00 A.M. when you know the system is not being used.  
>* You are not worried about this increased elapsed time and will welcome the increased system responsiveness during normal use.  
>* The rest of the month this plugin will do nothing as there is no active parity check in progress when the start time for an increment comes around.

The automatic check is run because if there are any parity errors this can compromise the ability to recover from an array drive failure at a later date so you want to get back to having valid parity as soon as is practical.

> If set to **Yes** then automatically start a tidy shutdown of the server if any disk in the array or a cache pool reach the defined temperature threshold.
> The temperatures are checked against the thresholds set for the **Critical** disk temperature levels. If a Critical temperature has been defined for an individual drive (accessed by clicking on the drive in the Main tab) then this is the value used.  If not the global setting (*<a href="Settings/DisplaySettings">Settings->Display Settings</a>) will be used.
>
>This option intended to be triggered if for some reason the system's cooling system is insufficient or if it has failed in some way. The idea is that you want to do a tidy shutdown before the disks become damaged due to overheating badly.   The shutdown that is triggered is functionally the same as would be the case of pressing the Shutdown button on the Main page of the Unraid GUI.  If notifications are enabled then you are sent one to indicate that this has happened.
>
>When the server is started up again after such a shutdown then when the array is started you will be notified that a temperature related shutdown happened in case you were not aware of the reason.
>
>**CAUTION:**  If the array is stopped while an array operation is incomplete then the progress so far is lost and it can only be restarted from the beginning.

>* **Parity Check Tuning**  
>* **Parity Problems Assistant**  
>depending on which part of the plugin generated the messages
>
>With the **Basic** option set these will only be a small number of messages indicating that this plugin has taken some action.
>
>Setting this option to **Debug** will result in additional entries being written to the syslog that give more information on what is happening when this plugin is running. They show how some of the internal operation of how the plugin is functioning. These additional entries are identified by the fact that they will have the word **DEBUG** added to the start of messages.  Some users (particularly those who have not used this plugin before) may like to use it to see more detail on how this plugin operates, but it is not expected that this option will be left enabled in normal running.
>
>Finally there is an additional setting of **Testing** that is only intended for use by the developer but is left here for convenience.  It will write even more verbose messages to the syslog but these are not likely to be interesting (or even meaningful) to the average user.  These messages will have the word **TESTING** added to the start of messages. You should only run this level of logging if you have been asked to as it can quickly fill up your syslog if you are not careful.
>
>Feedback is welcome as to whether it is worth introducing any intermediate option that outputs information type messages on the plugins activity, while omitting some of the lower level detail that is aimed at diagnosing any problems that might be encountered while the plugin is running.
